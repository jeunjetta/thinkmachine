* ThinkableType 2-point connector without bridge
 - A -> B -> C
 - 1 -> 2 -> 3
 - B -> 2 (shouldn't use bridge...except...when?)

* iOS / Android testing..whole website & app
* Docs
- cac.app — enter email placeholder, little more UI improvement
 - link to docs
- ask before quitting if unsaved changes

* Rate limits
* Blog post - recorder
- Blog — How Think Machine Was Built
- Blog auto search
- Walkthrough video for each documentation page

- changelog / in repo and on website
- context adder should be simpler...a button clear everything
- console needs work
 - should be able to edit it
 - should be able to load context up from an existing item (continue it)
 - delete an individual data item
 - add a data item
 - edit
 - should be really simple. textarea with csv?
- obsidian / json canvas
- if you're going to do these, do them sooner than later and figure out the UI/data model
  - notes, add text to a node
  - label a hyperedge
- Simplify bridge sync/async concept between electron + web. should have same interface on both
- easier to delete a node...right click menu options? rename? add to context?
- tilde key is confusing...needs an icon. need an easier way to edit data. remove console?
- Keyboard shortcut menu
- Amplitude Analytics
- depth needs a lot of work
- App Stores
  - Publish to Mac App Store
  - Publish to Windows App Store
- Onboarding video linked
- (Right?) Click to focus on a node
 - perfect place to display more information and context about what you're reading
 - could offer a popup menu to do more things (delete, rename, etc..)
 - should be able to navigate through hypergraph like this with keyboard or mouse
    - ...next, next next would be a cool recorder visualization too


* WEBSITE
- track custom data on purchase for attribution
- Add Testimonials
- have a bunch of embeddable examples on home page, let people click and see what's interesting..maybe don't make the default generate?
  - full screen mode
  - embed think machine above the fold in thinkmachine.com?

* MARKETING
- Update marketing video with new features
- Full Launch
- Public knowledge graph gallery
- ads

* WEB
- Sign up for higher limits
- pro -> HD/long video renderings
- pro -> modify prompt
- pro -> modify colors
- pro -> private knowledge graphs

* ELECTRON
- electron: scraping -> proxy api key?


* FUTURE
- Hold shift while clicking changes current context to be that context
- (maybe?) Make desktop version work with 1-click ModelDeployer rate limited tokens


* SUPER FUTURE
- iOS / Android apps?
- URL scraping should be very accurate. we don't want to generate too much, just take from what's there. needs new prompt
  - PDFs extraction -> scraping web
- There's an opportunity to make updates even smoother
 - Issue is switching from Isolated -> Confluence, the node IDs actually change
 - If there was a way to grab it's old node ID, that may or may not work
- Tool calling, have chat generate new data/search/add, based on topics
- What kinds of tests could we add? Integration tests kinda suck, but app is getting complex
- inline browser? could be useful for quickly seeing references
- Google Extension...right-click any word and get a knowledge graph?
- VR/AR would be super dope
- collaboration, make actions async 
- Copy & paste nodes
- 360 photo
- Clicking a node to search could/should have an alternate feature of just expanding that node out by 1 depth. with filters it makes it hard because so many pop in...but if just a few popped in (and you could easily see how many more there were down that path)
- Minimap: https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph/issues/490
- Layout
 - Could give more specific control over sublayout
   - Line wide
   - Arrow sizes
   - Bridge nodes
   - Confluence nodes
   - PageRank
   - Similar Embeddings
   - more controls to manipulate
- Background sync UI
- linux
- Pagerank UI
- Embeddings / Vector Search
- AI Autocomplete in text input
- multiple tabs/windows
- fix zoom and rotate axis bugs
- Distribution
  - ChatGPT plugin
  - Pinokio Store
  - iOS App
  - Obsidian Plugin
- image mode, dream machine — where nodes turn into images
