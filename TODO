* cac.app — enter email placeholder, little more UI improvement

* get menu working

* electron: wormhole
* electron: scraping -> proxy api key?

* massive refactor
* tests
* post blog post?
* depth needs a lot of work
* reduce cases of isWeb & isElectron...make services
* changelog / in repo and on website
* rate limit

* Add githook to check versions are the same?


* Shared README
* Can we create a package.json in common and not have it mess up?
  * If so, create shared scripts, npm run desktop, npm run web
* Depth is still messed up. If you go down depth, it loses maxDepth

* Hold shift while clicking changes current context to be that context


---

**Common**

* Keyboard shortcut menu
* Amplitude Analytics


**Electron**

* license
* Update README
* Make desktop version work with 1-click ModelDeployer rate limited tokens


**Web Version**

* rate limit (based on guid & ip)
* premium version
  - paddle SaaS integration
  - redo pricing page to show all options (open source, desktop, web, saas)
  - unlimited generations
  - customize prompt
  - more LLMs
  - private knowledge graphs
* different keyboard shortucts, should desktop change too?
* Update README


**Deploy**

* Update github repos
* Update Open-Source links on website
* Deploy website
* Copy over release from thinkmachine to thinkmachine-web before you rename back to thinkmachine
* Release update
* update ads



**Website**

 - Add Testimonials
 - Landing Page
   - Should app.thinkmachine.com become thinkmachine.com? and just move the marketing site to /about? /desktop
   - have a bunch of examples on home page, let people click and see what's interesting..maybe don't make the default generate?
    - full screen mode
    - embed think machine above the fold in thinkmachine.com?





**Near-future**

* Simplify bridge sync/async concept between electron + web. should have same interface on both

* Thinkable Type should have new concept of mini bridge, a two-item hyperedge, A->B or a double bridge A -> B && B -> A. These shouldn't use typical bridges, but confluence bridges to make the graph smaller.

* console needs work
 * should be able to edit it
 * should be able to load context up from an existing item (continue it)
 * delete an individual data item
 * add a data item
 * edit
 * should be really simple. textarea with csv?

* URL scraping should be very accurate. we don't want to generate too much, just take from what's there. needs new prompt
  * PDFs extraction -> scraping web
* obsidian / json canvas
* notes, add text to a node. what about a hyperedge?
* Improve Onboarding
  * Onboarding video linked
* easy to to render an image from CSV...people just want to do cool visualization pictures

* QUESTION: should adding data should really add a filter..otherwise you can't see what you just added
  * perhaps we just zoom the camera to make sure we can see that position?

* ask before quitting if unsaved changes

* Click to focus, should be able to navigate through hypergraph like this with keyboard or mouse
 * perfect place to display more information and context about what you're reading
* Emit link particles to see how things flow through the graph


**Future**
* There's an opportunity to make updates even smoother
 * Issue is switching from Isolated -> Confluence, the node IDs actually change
 * If there was a way to grab it's old node ID, that may or may not work

* Tool calling, have chat generate new data/search/add, based on topics

* If you could update/reload/filter the Graph without reloading it all, that would be phenomenal
* What kinds of tests could we add? Integration tests kinda suck, but app is getting complex
 * inline browser? could be useful for quickly seeing references
 * Chat integration, chat with your knowledge graph

- Google Extension...right-click any word and get a knowledge graph?
- VR/AR would be super dope
- collaboration, make actions async 
- let users change colors
- Visually connect two links
- Label a hyperedge
- Delete individual nodes, not just a hyperedge
- Copy & paste nodes
- App Stores
  - Publish to Mac App Store
  - Publish to Windows App Store



**Super Future**

- Clicking a node to search could/should have an alternate feature of just expanding that node out by 1 depth. with filters it makes it hard because so many pop in...but if just a few popped in (and you could easily see how many more there were down that path)

- Minimap: https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph/issues/490

- Layout
 - Could give more specific control over sublayout
   - Line wide
   - Arrow sizes
   - Bridge nodes
   - Confluence nodes
   - PageRank
   - Similar Embeddings
   - more controls to manipulate

- Easy way to print out mind maps
 - Export to high-res
 - Connect with website to print them


- what would HTML -> Think Machine look like? browsing the web with think machine? 2-way links like ted nelson intended?

- Background sync UI
- linux
- Pagerank UI
- Embeddings / Vector Search
- AI Autocomplete in text input
- multiple tabs/windows
- fix zoom and rotate axis bugs
- Distribution
  - ChatGPT plugin
  - Pinokio Store
  - iOS App
  - Obsidian Plugin

- image mode, dream machine — where nodes turn into images
